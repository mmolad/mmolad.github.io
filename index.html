<h1>Hi, I'm Mickey.</h1>
<p>My name is <strong class="me">Mickey Molad</strong> and I'm a communications professional doing work in the social media, community management, and web marketing spaces.</p>
<p>You've probably seen my community management and social media work with several famous companies: <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong>, <strong>AMD</strong>, <strong>Certain Affinity</strong>.</p> 
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p>Since 2007, I've been working in the gaming and high tech space. I started as a simple customer service agent ("<em>Game Master</em>"), and grew to building teams and processes spanning the entire globe. I've been at it for over 15 years now, with a diverse repeotoire with a focus on user engagement, growth, and high stakes communications.</p>
<p>At <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong>, I helped launch our Global Customer Support Operations department, giving customer service agents the tools and knowledge they needed to transition the company from traditional games to games as a service (GaaS). I led a team of knowledge management experts as we enabled customers to help themselves, while also empowering our agents to help players effectively and effeciently.</p>

<p>At <strong>AMD</strong>, I launched several products, including a reboot of our gaming and graphics lineup in an incredibly competitive field. I managed communications and social media for go-to-market campaigns, including paid social advertising and influencer marketing. I helped rebuild our gaming brand, focusing on our AMD Radeon products, and partnerships with Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation, and the Valve Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Most recently, at <strong>Certain Affinity</strong>, I was head of all communications, helping revamp our external and internal procedures, rebrand ourselves on social media, and rebuild our entire web presence. I served as crisis communications manager helping ensure our brand reputation as a top AAA developer remained intact despite a challenging industry landscape.</p>
<p>As a volunteer, I help operate several gaming fan communities, including <strong><i>Overwatch</i></strong> and <strong><i>Hearthstone</i></strong> on Reddit and Discord. I've helped grow these communities from just a few thousand members to millions worldwide, becoming by far the biggest sources of community discussion for these games.</p>
<p>As part of my web design work, I've also contributed to the subreddit designs of Corsair, <i>Death Stranding</i>, <i>Rocket League</i>, <i>Black Desert Online</i>, <i>Lawbreakers</i>, <i>ArcheAge</i>, <i>RUST</i>, and more. Components of my UX and design work were also directly integrated into the official Reddit Redesign. </p>
<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy web development work, building on the professional requirements that have crossed my desk over the years. I am an avid CSS fan, and love finding engaging ways to make content accessible and compelling to users across all devices. You can see a small sample of the work on my <strong>CodePen Portfolio</strong>: <a href="https://codepen.io/mmolad"><i class="fa-brands fa-codepen"></i> codepen.io/mmolad</a>.</p>
<p>I play a lot of <i>World of Warcraft</i>, where I currently lead a Top 400 NA raiding guild. Leading a guild is some of my most satisfying work, from planning weekly events, roster management of 30+ adults, performance measurement and improvement, recruiting, and a small community to manage. I'm proud of what we accomplish as a group and share the success of my guild any opportunity I can!</p>

<p>You can also catch me on my other current favorite games: <i>Helldivers 2</i>, <i>Balatro</i>, <i>Civilization VI</i>, <i>Last Epoch</i>, <i>Stellaris</i>, and <i>DRAGON BALL FighterZ</i>.</p>
